 1. The first step in this assignment is to learn the standard
    higher-order functions on lists, which you will use a lot.
    Suppose you need a list, or a Boolean, or a function---what can
    you call?

    Review Sections 2.7.2, 2.8.1, and 2.8.2.  Now consider each
    of the following functions:

          map  filter  exists?  all?  curry  uncurry  foldl  foldr

    Put each function into exactly one of the following four categories:

    **(B)** Always returns a Boolean  
    **(F)** Always returns a function  
    **(L)** Always returns a list  
    **(A)** Can return anything (including a Boolean, a function, or a list)

    After each function, write (B), (F), (L), or (A):

         map   L

         filter L 

         exists? B 

         all?  B

         curry  F

         uncurry F 

         foldl  A

         foldr  A



 2. Here are the same functions again:

          map  filter  exists?  all?  curry  uncurry  foldl  foldr

    For each function, say which of the following five categories best
    describes it.  Pick the most specific category (e.g., (S) is more
    specific than (L) or (M), and all of these are more specific than (?)).

    **(S)** Takes a list and a function and always returns a list of *the same* 
    size  
    **(L)** Takes a list and a function and always returns a list of *at least*
    the same size  
    **(M)** Takes a list and a function and always returns a list of *at most*
    the same size  
    **(?)** Might return a list  
    **(V)** Never returns a list

    After each function, write (S), (L), (M), (?), or (V):

         map  S

         filter  M

         exists?  V

         all?  V

         curry V 

         uncurry V 

         foldl ? 

         foldr ?



 3. Here are the same functions again:

          map  filter  exists?  all?  curry  uncurry  foldl  foldr

    Put each function into exactly one of the following categories. Always pick
    the most specific category (e.g. (F2) is more specific than (F)).

    **(F)** Takes a single argument: a function  
    **(F2)** Takes a single argument: a function *that itself takes
    two arguments*  
    **(+)** Takes more than one argument

    After each function, write (F), (F2), or (+):

         map  +

         filter  +

         exists?  +

         all?  +

         curry  F2

         uncurry  F

         foldl  +

         foldr +

 4. Review the difference between `foldr` and `foldl` in section 2.8.1.
    You may also find it helpful to look at their implementations in
    section 2.8.3, which starts on page 130; the implementations are
    at the end.

    (a) Do you expect `(foldl + 0 '(1 2 3))` and `(foldr + 0 '(1 2 3))` 
        to be the same or different?

Same

    (b) Do you expect `(foldl cons '() '(1 2 3))` and 
        `(foldr cons '() '(1 2 3))` to be the same or different?

Different

    (c) Look at the initial basis, which is summarized on 156.
        Give one example of a function, other than `+` or `cons`, that
        can be passed as the first argument to `foldl` or `foldr`, such
        that `foldl` _always returns exactly the same result_ as `foldr`.

*

    (d) Give one example of a function, other than `+` or `cons`, that can be
        passed as the first argument to `foldl` or `foldr`, such that
        `foldl` _may return a different result_ from `foldr`.

    _You are now ready to tackle all parts of exercises 14 and 15._

 5. Review function composition and currying, as described in
    section 2.7.2, which starts on page 125.  Then judge the
     _proposed_ algebraic laws below, which propose equality of
     functions, according to these rules:

       - Assume that names `curry`, `o`, `<`, `*`, `cons`, `even?`,
         and `odd?` have the definitions you would expect, but that
         `m` may have any value.

       - Each law proposes to equate two functions.  If the functions
         are equal---which is to say, when both sides are applied to
         an argument, they always produce the same result---then mark
         the law **Good**.  But if there is any argument on which the
         left-hand side produces *different* results from the right,
         mark the law **Bad**.
     
     Mark these laws:

        ((curry <) m)     == (lambda (n) (< m n))
Good
        ((curry <) m)     == (lambda (n) (< n m))
Bad
        ((curry cons) 10) == (lambda (xs) (cons 10 xs))
Good
        (o odd?  (lambda (n) (* 3 n))) == odd?
Good
        (o even? (lambda (n) (* 4 n))) == even?
Bad
    _You are now ready to tackle the first three parts of exercise 19,
    as well as problem **M** below._
