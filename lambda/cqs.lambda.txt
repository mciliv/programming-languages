 1. *Syntax of lambda terms*.  In this assignment, or in Rojas or Panangaden,
    read about [the concrete syntax of lambda-terms](#the-syntax-of-terms).  
    Now define, in Standard ML, an algebraic data type `term` that
    represents the _abstract_ syntax of terms.  Your data type should
    have one value constructor for a variable, one for a lambda
    abstraction, and one for an application.

   datatype term = VAR of name
                 | LAM of name * term
                 | APP of term * term


    You are ready for exercise 5, and you have a foundation for
    exercises 6 and 8.


 2. *Recognizing redexes*. Read about redexes in
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Reduction).
    (You will then follow up with 
    [Panangaden](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/readings/prakash.pdf)
    and 
    [Loczewski](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/readings/loczewski.pdf).)

    (a) Wikipedia mentions two kinds of redex.  What are their names?

    beta redex and eta redex

    (b) In Panangaden, Definition 1.7 defines a redex.  Which of the
        two redexes mentioned in Wikipedia is being defined here?

    beta

    Your code will have to recognize redexes, and it starts with
    knowing the form of each kind.  Panangaden gives one form; for the
    other, the best source is probably section 3.4 of Loczewski, where
    you will find the redex on the left-hand side of the *reduction*
    rule.


    (c) For each of the two kinds of redex, use the concrete syntax
        for our lambda interpreter ([see above](#the-syntax-of-terms))
        to show what form every redex of that kind takes.

        Eta:
            \x.M x

        Beta:
            (\x.M) N



    (d) For each of the two kinds of redex, use your algebraic data
        type from the preceding question to write a pattern that
        matches every redex of that kind.

        Eta:
            \x.M x --> M   provided x is not free in M

        Beta:
            (\x.M) N --> M[x := N]  


    You are getting ready for exercise 8 (reductions).





 3. *Practicing reduction*.  Read about
    [reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Reduction) 
    on Wikipedia.  Then in
    [Panangaden](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/readings/prakash.pdf),
    be sure you have an idea about each of these concepts:

      - Capture-avoiding *substitution* (Definition 1.3)
      - *Reduction* (Definition 1.5), including the example reduction (Example 1.3)
      - *Redex*, *contractum*, and *normal form* (Definitions 1.7 and 1.8)

    Showing each reduction step, reduce the following term to normal form.
    At each step, choose a redex and replace the redex with its contractum.
    Do not expand or replace the names `ZERO` and `NONZERO`.

        (\n.(n(\z.NONZERO))ZERO)(\f.\x.f x)
        → ((\f.\x.f x)(\z.NONZERO))ZERO
        → (\x.\z.NONZERO x)ZERO
        → \z.NONZERO ZERO

    The term contains more than one redex, but no matter which redex
    you choose at each step, you should reach the normal form after
    exactly four reductions.


    You are preparing to complete exercise 8.  


 4. *Reduction: the general case*.  For each kind of redex, repeat the
    general form of the redex from question 2(c) above, then show what
    syntactic form the redex reduces to (in just a single reduction step).


        Eta:
            \x.M x --> M   provided x is not free in M

        Beta:
            (\x.M) N --> M[x := N]  



    You are getting ready for exercise 8 (reductions).


 5. *When to reduce*. Read about normal-order and applicative-order
    [reduction strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Reduction_strategies).
    (This reading is terse and may be heavy going.)
    Using [the concrete syntax defined above](#the-syntax-of-terms),
    write a lambda term that contains exactly two redexes, such that
    _normal-order_ reduction strategy reduces one redex, and
    _applicative-order_ reduction strategy reduces the other redex.


    (λx.y (λx.x λx.x))



    You are (finally!) ready for exercise 8.

 6. *Understanding Church numerals*.  You may recognize the practice
    reduction as a computation to tell whether a Church numeral is
    zero.  Read about Church numerals, either on pages 9 and 10 of
    Panangaden or in Section 2 of Rojas ("Arithmetic").  Then, say
    whether each of the following lambda-calculus terms is a Church
    numeral.  If so, write the corresponding decimal representation.
    If not, write "not a Church numeral".

        \f.x - Not
        \f.\x.x - 0
        \f.\x.f - Not
        \f.\x.f x - 1
        \x.\x.f (f (f (f (f x)))) - Not
        
    You are ready for exercises 1 to 4.
