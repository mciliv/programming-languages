  (* Calling `checkExn show name test` has these effects:
       Expression `test()` is evaluated, and if it raises an exception,
       the test passes.  If `test()` returns a value, the test fails.

val checkExnSatisfiesWith : ('a -> string) -> string -> (unit -> 'a) -> (string * (exn -> bool)) -> unit
  (* Calling `checkExnSatisfiesWith show name test (ename, predicate)` 
     has these effects:
       Expression `test()` is evaluated, and if it raises an exception `e`,
       the test passes, provided `predicate e` is true.  If `test()` raises
       a non-satisfying exception, or if `test()` returns a value, the test fails,
       complaining that exception `ename` was expected.
       If the test fails, `name` is used to identify the failing test.

       Example:
           checkExnSatisfiesWith
              Int.toString
              "sum of big ints overflows"
              (fn () => valOf Int.maxInt + valOf Int.maxInt)
