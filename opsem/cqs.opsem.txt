COMP 105 - Opsem,
Reading-Comprehension Questions

Name: Morgan Ciliv

For questions 1--7, please read pages 18--26 (the book sections on
environments and on operational semantics of expressions).
These questions are multiple-choice.  Questions 1 to 3 offer one set
of choices, and questions 4 to 6 offer another set of choices.

 1. $\xi$ is an environment that maps names to

    (f) *only* the values of global variables.

 2. $\phi$ is an environment that maps names to

    (c) *both* primitive and user-defined functions.

 3. $\rho$ is an environment that maps names to

    (b) *only* the values of formal parameters.

 4. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    metavariable $e$ stand for?

    (d) an expression

 5. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    metavariable $v$ stand for?

    (e) a value

 6. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    phrase $\rho\{x \mapsto 7\}(x)$ stand for?

    (b) an impcore variable

 7. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    phrase $\rho\{x \mapsto 7\}\{x \mapsto 8\}$ stand for?

    (a) an environment

For questions 8 and 9, please read section 1.1.5 (page 14) 
on the difference between primitive functions and predefined
functions, and please study the rules for function application in
section 1.4.6, which starts on page 25.

Answer each question with *all* of the rules that could apply:

 8. Function `<=` is in the initial basis but is not a primitive
    function---it is a *predefined* function.  When evaluating
    `(<= 0 n)`, what rule or rules of the operational semantics could
    be used at the root of the derivation?  Please list them all.
    (Depending on the value of `n`, more than one rule could be
    possible.)

    IfTrue and IfFalse

 9. Function `=` is *primitive*.  When evaluating `(= n 10)`, what
    rule or rules of the operational semantics could be used at the
    root of the derivation?  Please list them all.  (Depending on the
    value of `n`, more than one rule could be possible.)
